"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,I hear this sentiment so often from creative entrepreneurs and small business founders
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Entrepreneurs by nature tend to be people who have big dreams and the guts to follow them
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"On the flip side, they often shy away from, look down upon, or downplay the details that go along with execution"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"You can set big, hairy, audacious goals for your company"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Goals are critical
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, You can also determine your core values
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," But without understanding what goes into the execution, you risk tanking your company"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,One concept to use for a framework around execution is the concept of profitability
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"When you think about the profitability of an idea, you need to think about two parts: what goes in and what comes out"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"People, resources, funds, and time go in"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, How big a step you can make toward reaching your goal is what comes out
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Here are three ways for a big picture creative think about profitability
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Money is a way of creating a measurable goal
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Some creative people feel shame about wanting to make money
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Or believe that it shouldn’t be a priority
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Especially if that creative is also a woman
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Not everyone is looking to make $1B
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Some goals align with giving back to a certain community
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Some companies are outright non-profit organizations
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, That’s ok
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," In order for you to further any goal that you have, you are going to need money"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Being fiscally responsible and socially conscious are not mutually exclusive
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,This is the fundamental concept of profit
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,I worked with a nonprofit company last year
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, They had an amazing cause and wanted to put on a huge fundraising event in support of their mission
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The leaders were well connected in the community
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, They knew they could host a large gala that would bring in quite a bit of money
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,I asked them to put together a budget for the event
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The number of people they wanted to invite meant they needed an enormous space
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The cost of the event space erased the amount of money they would raise for the organization
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," So, the revenues would be large, but the profits would not exist"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,We figured out a way to scale back the event
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The revenues were not as high as if they had hosted a grand affair
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," But more money came back to the organization, which was the goal"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"The moral is, if you have to spend $2 to bring yourself $1 closer to your goal, you better have a great rationale to do it"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Not every opportunity is going to result in profit right away
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, But an idea now can mean more profit down the road
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, It's pretty common for a biotech or pharma product to lose money in the first year it is on the market
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, A lot of money is required to get a sales force up to speed and a marketing campaign right
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, That early investment in a product will pay off massive dividends in years 2–10
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The revenues from those latter years will more than make up for the early investments
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, So the investment is worthwhile
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Its ok if an idea isn’t profitable right away
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Investing in things like coaching or writing classes don’t have an obvious near-term profit
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," But, have a well-informed opinion on the timeline"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, And how much money you might need to invest until you reach that point
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Profit is only one way to think about executing on your goals and your vision
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, But it is a framework
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, It makes you think about a few of the puzzle pieces that need to fit together to create the bigger picture
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, And those little pieces might not be as dramatic or fun as the big dreams
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," But without them, execution becomes nearly impossible"
"Deb Knobelman, PhD",https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,What drives you crazy? What can you just not understand? Why is something the way that it is? Why isn’t it better?
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Ask yourself these questions to identify the problem you are going to solve when starting a business
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," For us, it was the complexity and time in the food delivery service market"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Each time we ordered food, it was a painstakingly long process, so we decided to fix it"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Entrepreneur Peter Rahal wanted pro-paleo food and snacks after his CrossFit workouts
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," But, there were none"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," So, he decided to make his own"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Five years later, his company RXBAR was sold to Kellogg’s for $600 million"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," To find an idea, find something that pains you"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,1
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Find Something That Pains You
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Finding something that bothers you is a great start, but if it does not bother other people as well, then you don’t exactly have a business"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Just because I don’t like when people pronounce it “Chipolte” rather than “Chipotle” does not mean everybody else feels the same!
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"My friends and I created a 5-question mini-survey and distributed it to the 75 students in our business program, asking about average order time and overall delivery experience satisfaction"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, We learned that we were not the only ones who wanted something more out of food delivery
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Navy Seal Randy Hetrick became bored of his mundane routine while he was deployed, he threw a jujitsu belt over a door and started doing pull-ups"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," He thought it was great, but did other exercisers without access to a gym have the same problem? Randy showed the idea to his Seal team and then other Seal members around the world, and pretty soon he created TRX bands, a $50 million fitness company"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,

Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Make Sure It Also Pains Other People
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,I was fortunate enough to have already been doing some work with a startup founder a few years older in the food delivery space
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, I told him that I would continue to work with him for free if he would help us get our endeavor off the ground
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," He agreed, and I can honestly say we would not have known the nitty gritty details of starting a business without him"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Michael Bloomberg bumped into a guy when he interviewed to become a trader at a firm called Salomon Brothers & Hutzler
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The man he bumped into was William R
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Salomon, and Bloomberg attributes his success to the way this man led by example and guided him through the process of becoming a businessman and an even better human being"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Bloomberg used this wisdom to create one of the largest companies and become one of the wealthiest men on the planet
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Even Bloomberg needed to find a guide
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Make sure you do the same
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,3
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Find The Right Guide
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"With our food delivery company, we made an absurdly simple email campaign with 30 emails we had from our classmates"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Our MVP was a one-option food delivery service where we told you exactly what we were making with a detailed ingredients list and nutritional information, and the only choice the consumer had to make was “meal” or “no meal"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"” We gathered enough ingredients for the people who replied, “meal” to the email, and I cooked 20 meals for our first order"
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, We charged people on Venmo and then asked for feedback
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, This dropped average order time to about one minute rather than the 27 it took us that Sunday
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Jordan “J” Gross,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"When Alli Webb took a few handfuls of supplies over to her friends’ house and started blow-drying their hair, she became better and better at it"

Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"I’ve talked about the stated reasons VCs give for passing: those that have to do with the market, founders, individual VC or firm, fundraising process, product or technology, and business model or go-to-market"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, But sometimes actions (or inactions) speak louder than words
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," If a VC goes silent on you at any point in the fundraising process, they’re not that interested"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," It’s poor form and you deserve a reason, but overflowing inboxes, portfolio company emergencies, and unwieldy and unpredictable schedules are the norm in our jobs"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, VCs will lose interest
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Speed kills in venture, so as a founder you should work to create and maintain momentum"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"In the spirit of transparency, the two most common reasons why I pass are first, not feeling strongly about the founders, and second, a lack of personal interest in or conviction about in the space"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, I’ve seen how hard it is to build a successful venture-scale company
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, It’s riddled with adversity
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Pivots and crises are the norm
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," If I don’t have a real connection with the founders in a space that they are mission-driven to care about immensely, it’s a pass"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Success takes a rare combination of exceptional people, timing, and technology"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," It’s a long, drawn-out battle, and VCs will crawl over broken glass for the founders we’ve chosen to back"
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Having conviction in either of these two components (or ideally both) will overcome almost any other reason for passing
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, VCs make exceptions for people and ideas that we think are truly exceptional
Sarah A. Downey,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"When you enjoy digital marketing more than the thing you’re actually selling, you’re free to be emotionally detached, allowing you to sell literally anything"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,That’s exactly what happened with Jackson Cunningham
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"He searched for a product that would sell, not one for which he had any personal affinity"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Very methodically, he plugged in keywords, analyzed online traffic, and assessed the current market offering for hundreds of products"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"He found an overlooked corner of the fashion sector that hadn’t been penetrated with a premium, high-quality, and high-priced option"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,He found authentic Italian artists who designed gorgeous masks and signed them
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, He invested his own money to source inventory
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,He spun up a Shopify store in the Spring and called the brand VIVO Masks
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Juggling this new project with his real estate business became untenable
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, He couldn’t do both
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Searching on the popular freelancing site Upwork, he found a local professional to take over his real estate work"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, But the person he met was not who he expected
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,He met Josh for coffee at a local shop and they hit it off
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Turns out, they read the same books and listened to the same podcasts"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," When Jackson mentioned the masks project, Josh was intrigued"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,The meeting was no longer a freelance interview
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Would you be interested in going in on VIVO Masks with me, fifty-fifty?” asked Jackson"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Josh nodded enthusiastically
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Unbeknownst to the duo at the time, this coffee meeting put the roots in the ground for a lifelong multi-business partnership"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Their skill sets were and still are complementary, says Jackson: Jackson is more operational and passionate about automation"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Josh is more strategic and adds a long-term mindset to their overall marketing plan
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Together, they manage a stable of contractors (more on how this exactly works soon)"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Having two of us helps smooth the inevitable highs and lows in motivation that come from running a business,” says Jackson"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," “When I’m down, he’s up, and when he’s down, I’m up — we keep each other balanced and focused"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"By October of the same year, the cofounders grew VIVO Masks to $30,000 a month in sales by October"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," They didn’t pay themselves a dime, but rather reinvested the revenue into growing inventory and marketing until they fully stopped the real estate business in the following Spring"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"The key to setting up an effective digital marketing funnel has nothing to do with tweaking online advertisement settings, copy, and the perfect software setup to form a “well-oiled machine” where every $1 spent nets $1"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"50 in revenue, says Jackson"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," “It’s much more human than that, especially at the beginning"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson says spend most of your time finding the absolute best possible product first
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“If you put most of your effort into sourcing the best possible product on the front end, it will make your marketing down the road much easier,” he says"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, He spoke about how his handmade masks have high-end artisanal Italian origins
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, “I can say with full integrity that I sell the highest-quality masquerade masks in the world
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Once you’ve found a “really nice” product to sell online, shift your thinking from short-term — “How do I get this to make money next month? — to long-term — “How do I get this to make money next year?”"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“There are a hundred options to create money next month but not so many options to create money next year,” says Jackson"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," “When you start to think more long-term, the possible growth strategies shrink down"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, It’s a much clearer way to think through growth options
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"He likens this way of thinking about marketing as “planting seeds” where you don’t reap the rewards quickly and the initiatives are a slower burn, such as partnerships, content pieces, and service enhancements like free shipping, but turn out to be more profitable and sustainable in the end"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"This Bezosian approach to growth has proven successful time after time, not only in business, but also in life"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," In his book, 12 Rules For Life, bestselling author Jordan B"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Peterson’s puts it most succinctly in Rule #7: “Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"For products, this means making it the highest quality product possible and not cutting corners, cheapening, or holding back anything that would stop your product from being the best possible version of itself"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Quality is meaningful, not expedient"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"For services, follow what the author of The 48 Laws of Power, Robert Greene, writes as the Fifth Law of Power: guard your reputation far above anything else"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Compromising your character may win the deal, appease yourself, or fatten the contract in the short-term, but once it’s ruined can never be regained again"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Think of how icons like Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and Kevin Spacey have been ruined by certain choices"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Reputation comes from what is meaningful, not expedient"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson explains how this principle applies to an e-commerce company:
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“You can spin up ads when you’re ready to scale,” he mentioned as an example of a strategy to hit short-term targets"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, But ads disappear as soon as you stop paying for them
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Whereas a well-written evergreen content piece, for example, can continue to provide value for years on end"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson points at venture-backed companies and summer project upstarts that aim to be successful as quickly as possible but are actually hindering their own growth by aiming at short-term targets
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Three years is the way to be thinking,” he says"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, Give the seeds some time to grow
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, It’s similar to working out in the gym
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," You won’t see immediate rewards, but with time you’ll start to see results"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"If you can think in this longterm mindset, “It’s very freeing,” Jackson says"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Less than a year later in 2012, VIVO Masks hit a ceiling in sales"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Jackson and Josh tried lots of things to continue the brand’s growth, such as adding fascinators to the site, but nothing moved the needle"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Nevertheless, the business was a steady cash calf (a small cash cow) and the cofounders looked at each other and said, “Let’s make twenty of these things"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Using a stack of keyword research, landing pages, and ad traffic data, Jackson began testing and validating all manner of products, from Japanese kimonos to wigs to dream catchers to top hats"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Choosing the right product to focus on was not black and white
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," Even worse, most of them could sell — top hats sold pretty well — but each product required an equal amount of work"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," The more stores they opened, the more work it would become"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, The idea of 20 online stores soon became unfeasible
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"During this process of validating various product ideas, Jackson learned a valuable lesson about how to choose a product"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Validating is overused,” he says"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, “What am I really validating — the fact that something will sell online? That’s not the hard part
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, I can definitely sell wigs online
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/, [The purpose of the validation period] is more like you’re giving yourself a confidence boost that will get you through the months to come when you’re selling barely anything
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,”
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson and Josh eventually landed on their second product: suspenders
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"They researched the suspenders market and found that 90% of the products were low-quality, mass-produced, or old-school grandpa ‘spenders that were too thick"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,So they set out to design their own and aimed at making them the best product in the market
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Similar to sourcing the masks from Italy, they sourced their suspenders materials and fabrics from the highest quality makers they could find — in England"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Soon they were manufacturing their own brand of suspenders at the level of quality they knew they could build a business with
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,This is a serious concern for early founders and has led to hellacious lawsuits for many
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson’s response to this concern was unflinching
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,He says:
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Anybody can make anything nowadays,” he says"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," “Often there’s not a lot you can do to protect your products from copycats, but the reality is that there are built-in and somewhat painful barriers to entry, like hefty startup and inventory costs, lower margins, and no first-mover advantage"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"As JJ Suspenders grew bigger, it reached a healthy sales mark, and yet, similar to VIVO Masks, it leveled off and led to diminishing returns"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Back to the drawing board but this time with more cash, Jackson wanted to give his girlfriend, who worked at a nonprofit, the same freedom he had as a digital entrepreneur"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/," She should start a company so they could travel together, he reasoned"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,“What are you interested in?” he asked her
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"“Cats,” she said"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Jackson typed “cats” into a search engine
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,"Cat memes, cat photos, cat costumes — all the things you would expect — showed up at the top of the search results"
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Except one keyword phrase stuck out
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,Cat tree
Dave Schools,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/,

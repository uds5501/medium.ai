David Smooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"In honor of Google’s support, we’ve dug into the Hacker Noon library, and would like to share 50 stories about Google*:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Learn how to generate lyrics using deep (multi-layer) LSTM in this article by Matthew Lamons, founder, and CEO of Skejul — the AI platform to help people manage their activities, and Rahul Kumar, an AI scientist, deep learning practitioner, and independent researcher"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,This article will show you how to create a deep LSTM model suited for the task of generating music lyrics
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, Here’s your goal: to build and train a model that outputs entirely new and original lyrics that is in the style of an arbitrary number of artists
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, You can refer to the code file found at Lyrics-ai (https://github
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,com/PacktPublishing/Python-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Chapter06/Lyrics-ai) for this exercise
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"To build a model that can generate lyrics, you’ll need a huge amount of lyric data, which can easily be extracted from various sources"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, You can find the code files at https://github
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,com/PacktPublishing/Python-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Chapter06/Lyrics-ai
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, These files contain a text file called lyrics_data
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"txt which includes lyrics from around 10,000 songs and stored them in"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Now that you have your data, convert this raw text into the one-hot encoding version:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"The overall objective of the pre-processing module is to convert the raw text data into one-hot encoding, as shown in the following diagram:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,This figure represents the data preprocessing part
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, The raw lyrics data is used to build the vocabulary mapping which is further been transformed into the on-hot encoding
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," After the successful execution of the pre-processing module, a binary file will be dumped as {dataset_filename}"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,vocab
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," This vocab file is one of the mandatory files that need to be fed into the model during the training process, along with the dataset"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,This article will take an approach from the Keras model and use TensorFlow to write each layer from scratch
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, TensorFlow gives you a more fine-tuned control over your model’s architecture
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," For this model, use the code in the following block to create two placeholders that will store the input and output values:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Next, store the weights and bias in the variables that you’ve created:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"You can build this model using multiple LSTM layers, with the basic LSTM cells assigning each layer with the specified number of cells, as shown in the following diagram:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,The following is the code for this:
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Now that you have the mandatory inputs, that is, the dataset file path, the vocab file path, and the model name initiate the training process"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, Define all hyperparameters for the model:
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Since this is a batch training the model, divide the dataset into batches of a defined batch_size using the Batch module:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,Each batch will return two arrays
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," One will be the input vector of the input sequence, which will have a shape of [batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size], and the other array will hold the label vector, which will have a shape of [batch_size, vocab_size]"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Now, initialize your model and create the optimizer function"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," In this model, you used the Adam Optimizer"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," Then, you’ll train your model and perform the optimization over each batch:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Once the model completes its training, the checkpoints are stored"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, You can use them later for inferencing
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, The following is a graph of the accuracy and the loss that occurred during the training process:
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,You can see that accuracy getting increased and loss getting reduced over the period of time
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Now that the model is ready, you can use it to make predictions"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, Start by defining all parameters
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," While building inference, you need to provide some seed text, just like you did in the previous model"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," Along with this, you should also provide the path of the vocab file and the output file in which you will store the generated lyrics"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/," Also, provide the length of the text that you need to generate:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Next, load the model by providing the name of model that you used in the training step in the preceding code, and restore the vocabulary from the file:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Use the stack methods to store the generated characters, append the stack, and then use the same stack to feed it into the model in an interactive fashion:"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"After successful execution, you’ll get your own freshly brewed, AI-generated lyrics reviewed and published"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, The following is one sample of such lyrics
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, Some spellings have been modified so that the sentences make sense:
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Here, you can see that the model has learned in the way it has generated the paragraphs and sentences with appropriate spacing"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, It still lacks perfection and also doesn’t make sense
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/,"Seeing signs of success — The first task is to create a model that can learn, and then the second one is used to improve on that model"
Packt_Pub,https://hackernoon.com/, This can be obtained by training the model with a larger training dataset and longer training durations

Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,"Today, I was asked by my employer for my GitHub password"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/," This is something I’m not willing to give out, especially since I work on other projects (outside of work) and am not willing to compromise anyone’s data"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,Does anyone have any advice on how to respond to this request?
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,This may be more of a rant here:
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,I ask this because the manager in question demands passwords from everyone for every bit of software and every single device their subordinates use
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/, That data is kept on a spreadsheet right on their desktop!!! They also remote in to work devices using insecure software and I’m basically waiting for the next data hack
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,UPDATE 1
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,UPDATE 2
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,The answer which received the most appreciations was written by Terence Eden
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,I’m going to respectfully disagree with the other answers
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/," Jobs are hard to come by, and sometimes we have to stay in abusive relationships in order to put food on the table"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,"Your long term plan should be to leave this company, or get them to change their policies"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,Your short term plan is this:
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,"Your employer will not be able to log in without your 2FA code, and you’ll be able to check for failed login attempts"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,To be clear — this is not a long term practical solution
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/," If you work in a large company, you should contact their information security team"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/," If you work in a regulated environment, you should discuss this with your regulators"

Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/,"Ultimately, no, you shouldn’t have to hand over your password"
Hashnode,https://hackernoon.com/, But 2FA will give you some protection and some breathing room until you can find a better solution

Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"If 2018 was the year of Big Data, then 2019 is going to be the year of using that data to tell a meaningful story"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,Most digital and physical products now require data collection in one form or another in order to function properly
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Compare television to YouTube; most programs and ads on TV don’t resonate with me, while everything I see on YouTube is there for a strategic, data-driven reason"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,Consumers are becoming increasingly aware that their data is worth a lot to the service provider
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, The transaction looks like this:
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,Your data is used to attract advertisers to fund the platform
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," In return, you get a customized experience based on your observed behaviour and preferences"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"Between the data breaches, Facebook fiascos, and companies continually refining our digital identities, data have been on everyone’s minds"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"The opportunity for businesses with data in the coming year revolves around how we use the data to deliver personalized, convenient, and magical experiences to the customers"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Doing so does not require more data, it requires you to design your data to tell a better story"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,A well-understood example of a data story is Fitbit tracking your everyday actions and then delivering them in a simple to understand metric: number of steps per day
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," They further simplified this by making it five LED lights represent 10,000 steps on some models"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," The story is simple; if you’ve got 4 blinking lights on your wrist at the end of the day, then you know it’s time to get off the couch and take a lap of the block before hitting the hay"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,I’d say that most consumers now understand that their data is being collected anywhere and everywhere
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, The issue is that not every service provider returns the favour by presenting the data back to the user in a way that’s meaningful to them
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, They don’t tell a story
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,The most timely example of a great data story is 2018 Wrapped that Spotify delivered earlier this month to every one of their over 191 Million users
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, It came in the form of an email celebrating being a customer for another year
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," When you clicked on the link, it brought you to a website asking you to sign in to see “how you listened”"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"To most recipients, the My Year In Review playlist was a personalized trip down memory lane, reminding you of artists and songs that you might have binged for a week then put back on the virtual shelf to rediscover later"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, This might remind people of the nostalgia of picking out a CD from the shelf and reminiscing as you look over the album artwork
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"The top ten lists of artists, songs, and genres are nice to validate your assumptions of what you listened to this year, but the storytelling comes when they make a customized playlist of 100 songs that will remind YOU of 2018"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, It’s different than a radio station playing THEIR top 100 songs of the year because you might not have actually enjoyed any of them
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," While artists like Ariana Grande are getting tons of attention for being the most listened to artists of the year, there were also a lot of people not listening to her, so why would I want her to end up on My Year In Review?"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,They then introduce you to a Tastebreakers playlist that offers you a playlist of 100 songs from genres or artists that you don’t often listen to but they’re willing to bet that you’ll enjoy
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, They are able to offer that playlist to you with such confidence because they’ve collected mountains of data on your listening habits
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," In my case, I averaged 2"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"8 hours per day or over 61,000 minutes of listening time over the last 12 months"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,This is a data story
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," To keep track of the number of minutes you listened to your CD collection over the last year would be a very burdensome task, but not for Spotify"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," It’s able to sit quietly and non-judgementally, listening to your musical life"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Spotify knows way, way more about your listening habits than they’re letting on with 2018 Wrapped"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," But rather than overwhelm(or maybe terrify) you, they change the narrative and tell you a story"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," We’re willing to give up our personal data as long as the products we get in return are enjoyable, convenient, and personalized to you"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,I personally would love to see what else Spotify has collected on my listening habits
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," I’m sure they know the ideal length of a song I enjoy, the beats per minute, and album cover colour I’m attracted to most"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, I’m also sure that they’re not going to share that story with their users anytime soon because it’s that ideal mix of data put through an algorithm that creates the magic of Your Discover Weekly playlist that I look forward to
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"You can learn a lot about anything if you spend that much time observing behaviours, and that’s where data is going to be taking us into 2019"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," We’ve figured out how to collect data, now it will come down to how are we going to use it"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, How are we going to use data to tell a story?
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"YouTube, with over 1"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,9 Billion monthly active users also tried to create an end of the year thank you to their users that ended up backfiring big-time
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, YouTube Rewind was released the same day as 2018 Wrapped and is an eight-minute-long video featuring creators and memes from the platform meant to induce nostalgia
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"Instead of creating an organic buzz around the community, it has gone down as the most disliked video on YouTube of all time"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," At the time of writing this, it had over 14 Million dislikes"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"If Spotify has mountains of data, then YouTube (through the Google network) would have mountains on mountains of data that they could have leveraged for this project"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"It wasn’t personalized, convenient, or magical"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Because of that, it was a flop"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Instead of increasing customer trust, it has added to the distaste in some of the recent activities occurring on the platform"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Instead of generating millions of positive user-generated posts, it has created thousands of reaction videos talking about how bad it is"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," As the age-old saying goes, “any publicity is good publicity”, but I don’t think that that’s what they were trying to do"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,They had the opportunity to show the magic that their platform could create by stitching together custom characters to match the watching habits of the account
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, They could have introduced foreign content creators
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Instead, they smashed all the featured creator’s names at the end credits"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,"I could go on about all the opportunities YouTube missed out on, but I’ll end it here"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," There are a lot of things YouTube Rewind did really poorly, especially compared to Spotify 2018 Wrapped"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,Let this be a lesson to others about how data stories are going to be more crucial than ever in 2019
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/, Others should learn from how simple and elegant their data delivery is to their customers without overdoing it
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," 2018 Wrapped is a beautifully engaging website, but not much more"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," There’s no real interaction with the content, no ability to explore, and no ability to play music from the web page"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," What there is, however, is the ability to share with others"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,What makes a good story? The ability to retell it
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," By sharing your story with the world, you keep the data flowing, adding to the network effect that makes data seriously powerful"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," As Kevin Kelly puts it,"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,So let’s satisfy these bits of data
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," Let’s connect them in new ways, remix them, and tell a new type of story"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/," If we don’t, we’ll be just another YouTube Rewind in a sea of data"
Stewart Hillhouse,https://hackernoon.com/,

Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Since Big Data has proven its usability in retail, marketing, and other areas, healthcare managers are now thinking about how to reap the benefits of this technology for their own problems"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Artificial intelligence in the form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can improve critical aspects of the patient-doctor relationship and can even go beyond this, simplifying the process of insurance payment"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"The expected advancement comes from making the clinical documentation more accessible through automatic indexing, thus adding search-ability"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, Another growth direction is the automatic voice-to-text feature which will enable the creation of automated digital records while allowing medical staff to focus their attention on patients instead of writing
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, This is solving the problem that more than 83% of physicians have reported: burnout
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"AI-powered personal assistants like Siri, Cortana or Alexa are already part of our daily lives, and we’re used to asking them for information, interacting with them in various ways and relying on their help"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," However, these are general-purpose tools"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," To perform in the medical field, it would be useful to have similar, medical-grade assistants"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,These virtual nurses could take notes and help doctors or even their human counterparts
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," For example, a smart system could take notes while a human nurse assesses a patient’s vital signs through voice activation, thus freeing up the nurse’s hands"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Also, the NLP-capable system can check on the patient to make sure they have taken their medicine, re-order some drugs as it sees that stocks are declining"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Chatbots can also take on some of the work currently performed by office assistants, nurses or even doctors for smaller practices"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," These tools can also create semi-automatically generated e-mails, handling scheduling or calendar management"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,The rise of technology has made most of us very independent and self-reliant
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, We don’t ask for directions anymore; we don’t need outside help
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," However, this attitude only works fine with non-critical aspects of our lives"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, Self-diagnosis using Google is incredibly dangerous
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," However, there are ways to create technology to improve our health in other ways"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Most clinics give their patients the option to access their data online, for example, seeing their results on portals or e-mails"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, This is an advantage for patients as most of them can’t wait to learn if they are okay or not
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, Text analysis of their EHR could help them translate specialized medical terms into simple information about the state of their health
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, This would contribute to the right decisions regarding lifestyle changes and active management of their conditions
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Also, it would mean that fewer visits to the doctor’s office would be required, thus helping those who live in remote areas or have limited mobility"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Through smart tools like these, you could increase the average patient’s knowledge of their health by helping them understand specialized language by simply asking the system, much like you ask Siri"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, Such a tool can make a huge difference for the peace of mind of the patient and save them and the doctor time which would have been used on such explanations
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,The next step is to create a medical lay-man dictionary of terms
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, Such a tool can be put together by applying NLP to medical records and could become the equivalent of Google Translate for medical documents
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"As NLP turns text into actionable information, this opens up new opportunities related to unstructured data lying around in medical records or other annotations doctors have made in their observation sheets"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Each patient has a unique story, development, and individual issues"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," If these individual data points could be gathered, centralized and structured, new patterns of disease and cures would emerge"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,Free text has this kind of limitation compared to structured data which is suitable for statistical analysis
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Due to the advancements of text analysis algorithms, experts from InData Labs highlight that better care will be available in a few different ways"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"First, processed textual observations can be analyzed and used as exclusion criteria"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," This is important in the case of drug cross-interactions, allergies and the existence of secondary conditions"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," If such a rule is met, the patient will not be given a certain drug which could cause them more harm than good, thus preventing additional complications"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Next, the information can be included in quantifiable structures and become the foundation for reports"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Qualitative information such as “heavy smoker” or “occasional drinker” could be understood by the software and coded appropriately, in a similar way this would be made on a scaled survey"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Subsequently, this could be used to compute various risk scores"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Lastly, the information existing in a narrative format in a patient’s EHR can be used to qualify the individual as being representative of a particular group"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," This could be helpful in identifying the right candidate for clinical trials, the best options for revolutionary treatments or those who are at the most significant risk"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"Currently, although these technologies have tremendous potential, they are underused, as Gartner showed in a study from 2016, there were under 5% of health systems benefiting from these advancements"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/, The remaining healthcare providers rely on coded data according to existing healthcare standards
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t cross reference conditions and treatments, thus having a unidimensional approach"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," Once text analytics become the norm, we can expect that patients’ EHR will become comprehensive data sources for multi-layer analysis"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," This will lead to a much broader understanding of patient populations, disease development and possible co-morbidities or treatment interactions"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,Another significant advantage of using these systems is their scalability and replicability
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," While currently there are only a handful of specialists who have competences in diagnosing some diseases, with such a system backed up by loads of data, identifying a certain medical condition or the high risk of developing it can be done by simply feeding the EHR into a software"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,We can expect that the text analysis powered by NLP to become a more prominent and widespread tool in the future
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/," In a decade, we might have apps which replace the majority of our current trips to the doctor’s office"
Sophia Brooke,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,Introduction
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,Making the transition from hands-on product management to leading a PM team can be disorienting
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," On the one hand, if you get overly involved with projects, you’ll stifle the creativity of the team"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," And it’s unsustainable to be on top of every detail, especially with products that require heavy domain knowledge"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," On the other hand, if you’re too hands-off, you risk allowing product changes that don’t meet your standards or big picture business objectives"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"More than once I’ve seen product leaders, unable to grasp their role, get arbitrarily involved in design decisions, seemingly out of a need to put their own “stamp” on the product"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Behavior like this demoralizes the team and creates a low value hoop in the product delivery cycle
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,But how far can you step back? The key is minimum viable control (MVC)
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, The essence of MVC is managing the structure of your team’s process without controlling the substance of launches
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,The Elements of MVC
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,I
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, A sound learning process
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"As a manager of PMs, as much as possible, I stay away from questioning the ideas and designs that come through the development cycle"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," However, I need to feel confident that each change is being sufficiently tested, validated, and evaluated post-launch"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,A sound learning process requires teaching your PMs to have a scientific and paranoid mindset
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, PMs should relentlessly pick apart and test each assumption underpinning product directions
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, They should be paranoid in imagining everything that might go wrong with each product change and take necessary measures (e
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,g
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,", through A/B testing) to avoid tanking business metrics"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"I created Double-Loop, in part, so teams can quantify the rigor of their learning process"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, With Double-Loop we can measure and continually improve how many of our launches have clear hypotheses and results
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,II: Cross-functional integration
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"As I discuss in The Product Management Triangle, near to the essence of product management is synthesizing the activities of the diverse set contributors spanning engineering, design, marketing, sales, and customer support"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," As a product leader, you must ensure that your team is incorporating inputs from across the organization in their ideation and prioritization process"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"Conversely, your PMs should treat internal communication with the same care as external communication"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," When sharing a product update or strategy, PMs must tailor their medium and message to the unique psychology of their cross-functional counterparts"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," For example, after a launch, your team may need to communicate different information to marketing than they do to customer support"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"As the product leader, you must create the bidirectional pipes of communication between all the people who touch the product"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Your job is not to oversee what content goes through the pipes
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," Instead, it’s to make sure that the right pipes exist, unobstructed"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,III
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Top-down integration
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,You have better visibility than your PMs into the big picture of the business
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," You’re more exposed to the workings of the board, dynamics of the executive team, and financial milestones"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," In contrast, your PMs should know more than you do about the functional workings of their product area and the nuances of their domains"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,Your job is to ensure that the work of your team reflects the big picture reality without dictating what your PMs build to achieve the goals
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," Objectives and key results (OKRs), for example, serve as a nice non-prescriptive interface with overarching business direction"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, The best formed OKRs provide stable criteria for what success looks like while not constraining tactics
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," Without something like OKRs in place, your team will feel like they’re floating without a foundation to stand on"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,Top-down integration must go both ways
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," While your team’s work must reflect objectives from up high, the learning of your team should influence how the executive team thinks"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Your team must abstract and communicate the results of their launches in a format that is clear from way up in the sky
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," Otherwise, antiquated strategies will keep raining down down"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,Conclusion
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"Maintaining a sound learning process, cross-functional integration, and top-down integration is a full time job that requires surprisingly little knowledge of the details of your product"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," In a sense, the product leader provides value as an outside observer who can objectively monitor how their team is working without micromanaging what they’re doing"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,"By staying at the level of MVC, you can achieve the best of many worlds"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Your team will be unleashed to solve problems and seize opportunities as they see fit
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/, Embedding your PMs in a rich network of horizontal and vertical information flow will fill their brains with the context to make wise decisions
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/," And the scientific process of testing and experimentation will make their failures safe, both financially and psychologically"
Daniel Schmidt,https://hackernoon.com/,
David Smooke,https://hackernoon.com/,"“Google Cloud Platform and Firebase give Hacker Noon the flexibility to craft a custom publishing platform optimized for technologists,” said Hacker Noon Interim CTO Dane Lyons"
David Smooke,https://hackernoon.com/," “Our serverless infrastructure will generate static content and pipe it into the low latency, low-cost Google Cloud CDN"

Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,The advances in wireless communications has led to an exponential growth in mobile devices i
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,e
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, smartphones
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," The deployment of 4G and LTE (Long Term Evolution) networks has delivered us more rich content, from video streaming to live gaming"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," It is taking its toll on bandwidth, which now needs to be addressed as demand grows"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," This time around a new class of applications that are bandwidth intensive like VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) and OTT will require it"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The telecom industry have specified a new standard called 5G to meet the growth of network demands
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," High speed data communications made possible by more bandwidth sounds like an excellent business proposition for wireless carriers to expand their networks, appease users and gain more subscribers while generating more revenues"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"This is also a new opportunity for developers to deploy applications that take advantage of fast, high-speed lower latency networks"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Emerging technologies like self-driving cars, serverless applications, autonomous vehicles, live online gaming, IoT devices, time sensitive telemedicine and even blockchain projects have a potential to benefit from this"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, It may even replace home cable networks as a residential broadband service
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The previous exponential growth in mobile and other computing devices can also be handled since 5G aims to provide more bandwidth
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Just 20 years ago we didn’t have billions of mobile users
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Now and beyond, the projections are seeing growth that have surpassed the billion mark"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, By 2020 there will be a projected 4
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,68 billion mobile users in the world
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," The growth is not that exponential as it begins to flatten out, but you have a large base of users from the previous years"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The data just shows us how large the mobile market is and its potential for 5G use
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, It is not indicative of who will use 5G which I shall explain later on
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,5G rollout is not without controversy though
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," There are always two sides to a story, and when it comes to 5G there are proponents who want to get the show on the road but there are also opponents who argue about the risk to public health and security that 5G networks may bring"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Who is right and who is wrong? At this point there are more questions than answers
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Let me begin by explaining what 5G is and then discuss the pros and cons
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,The wireless communications industry is introducing 5G as the successor to current 4G LTE networks
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, 4G used LTE and WiMax to deliver a peak speed of 100 Mbps to wireless devices
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," 5G has a peak data rate of 20 Gbps, using eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, That increases the bit rate which increases speed and that can also lower delays in content delivery to mobile devices
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Users on facetime will have little to no lag and downloading large files will be effortless
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,With faster 5G connectivity access to content will increase tremendously and speeds will increase significantly
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Watching 4K UHD content on mobile devices will stream effortlessly
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, A doctor can have a smooth video conference with a patient with more clarity and audio fidelity
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Gamers can now play more immersive video games in VR while chatting, streaming and downloading at the same time"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, More cloud based collaboration among peers
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, 5G may also facilitate the rise of smart cities and self-driving cars
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, These are just some of the many benefits that 5G can provide once it is rolling
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"5G uses what are called “millimeter waves”, or short wavelength radio signals"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This requires a new swath of bandwidth that is allocated on the frequency spectrum between 30–300 GHz
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This increases the bandwidth available to cram more data and accommodate more users
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," This will require shorter wavelengths than previous networks, which means they cannot travel longer distances"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, These signals also cannot easily penetrate through walls and are easily absorbed by moisture and foliage
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, So why would engineers build a system that cannot travel far and has major drawbacks? That leads to the second feature of 5G (next item)
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"To make sure that signals are able to travel farther without fading, “small cell” towers using a dense deployment will be installed within an area to handle the signaling"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, They will be much smaller than your typical cellular tower
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," These small cell towers will be placed within a distance of no less than 200 feet and no more than 1,000 feet apart, so they are pretty close to each other"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The advantage to being smaller is that there is more versatility to where they can be installed
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," They can be put on the side of buildings, utility poles, apartment rooftops just to give a few examples"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The small cells then transmit and receive data on the 5G network covering a certain area
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," So the idea of 5G is replacing high power, low frequency towers with low power, high frequency small cells that communicate with a base station"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"To handle data traffic signaling, “beamforming” will be used"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, It determines the most efficient data delivery route in a 5G network
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Beamforming actually sends the data from the small cell directly to the user
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Since the signal is more concentrated, it reduces interference as well"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Like its predecessor 4G, a 5G network makes use of packet switching over an IP network for data delivery"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,MIMO or “Multiple-Input Multiple-Output” allows more signals to be sent and received at any given moment
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This is implemented by installing more antennas as an array in a small cell
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The problem of having so many antennas installed is addressed by beamforming
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," With MIMO, a base station can send and receive more signals to boost the capacity of a 5G network by a factor of 22, first reported by engineers at the University of Bristol and Sweden’s Lund University"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,FACT: Wireless providers don’t actually use full-duplex transceivers
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," In a 5G network, the use of full-duplex will allow data to be transmitted and received on base station transceivers at the same time using the same frequency"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Past systems that supported full-duplex communications had to separate frequency channels to allow 2 users to communicate at the same time without having to take turns transmitting and receiving
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Now it is possible using just one frequency channel through a circuit design which utilize high speed switching in the silicon
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This allows antennas to transmit and receive while the incoming and outgoing signals are routed
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,It looks pretty straightforward on paper
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, 5G is just another iteration of a wireless communication system that aims to deliver faster data speeds and handle more users
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, There are 2 main issues that critics are concerned about: public health and network security
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"Activists, researchers and health professionals alike have concern for the high frequency millimeter radio signals that 5G uses"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Since many small cells will be installed in close proximity to people, there must be a concerted effort to further research and evaluate the effects it could have"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, There are physicians who warn that the amount of radiation 5G small cells emit can have irreversible effects on people who live or are exposed to these radio waves on a daily basis
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,These reports are alarming and can be a cause for fear
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, I don’t dismiss them at all because before any public rollout of a project there should always be an environmental impact assessment that includes public health and safety
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," While most critics point out the possible harm 5G can cause, there have been no significant studies that positively without a doubt prove that wireless networks have increased cancer or other illnesses"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Epidemiological studies don’t have any conclusive evidence that correlates wireless and mobile use to higher incidents of diseases like cancer
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, We shouldn’t ignore the reports though because this is an opportunity for regulators to take a further look into 5G operation and whether it is safe to deploy
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"The high frequency in question is the range 5G uses, which can go as high as 300 GHz"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, In the electromagnetic spectrum the range of harmful radio waves are in the gamma ray and x-ray range
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The range 5G uses is in the microwave range of the spectrum
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Some activists wrongly believe that 5G signals are like that used in microwave ovens
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," While that is true, that 5G signals are in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, there is a difference between a small cell and an oven"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Microwave ovens use high energy to cook food from the inside out
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Small cells use low energy to transmit and receive radio signals
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, They have different applications of radio waves
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"If you live in a sunny region like Southern California, you are already being exposed to more radiation than microwave signals from 5G"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This is because visible light has a higher frequency than 5G signals and people are more exposed to sunlight
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, People can also get diseases from too much exposure from a component in sunlight that comes from ultraviolet rays
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The range of high frequency radiation above visible light that poses dangers to health are gamma rays and x-rays aka “ionizing radiation”
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Prolonged exposure causes cellular damage and also affects DNA so they are very harmful
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, That is why during an x-ray a patient is given special preparation and only a quick exposure to them
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," This is because x-rays can penetrate through skin and bone, thus we can develop them as an image on film making them highly valuable diagnostic imaging systems for healthcare"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, 5G signals do not penetrate human skin and bone
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Most of the radiation in this range of frequencies is in the form of heat, which does not disrupt or destroy human tissue during transmission of radio waves"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,More serious academics don’t argue that people are already exposed to higher frequency visible light and even infrared which is used in TV remote controls
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," However the issue is that when you deploy a system of 5G small cells, they are continuously transmitting wireless signals that bombard its surroundings, including people"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Though 5G uses beamforming to concentrate signal transmission rather than broadcasts, critics will still want more evaluation and testing to verify the safety of 5G"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"Many research reports, in general, do not find any overall harmful effects on human health from radio waves"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) actually has strict regulations on radio waves based on the SAR (Specific Absorption Rate)
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The SAR is the amount of energy allowed to be absorbed by a certain part of the body that is deemed the limit for public safety
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The FCC rule is that SAR level must be at or below 1
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,6 W per kilogram (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1 gram of tissue absorbing the most signal
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," For 5G developers and telecom carriers, compliance to these standards are a must for business operations so as not to endanger the public"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,The WHO (World Health Organization) states that:
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,(Source: WHO About Electromagnetic Fields — Summary of Health Effects Key Point 6)
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"In another WHO study, we must still be cautious and proceed with research on the effects of radio waves"

Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,One report on the concerns regarding 5G can be read from an article published by Dr
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Cindy Russell (Santa Clara Medical Association)
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,There is no perfect system that is 100% secure from cybersecurity attacks
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," All it takes is putting a server out on a public network and it is exposed to all users, good and bad"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Since 5G aims to provide a backbone that brings more speed for IoT devices in homes and businesses, it also increases the threat vectors for hackers"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This is to be taken seriously since more devices will have capabilities to connect to high speed networks
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, That is also an opportunity for hackers to target more devices
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,An issue with new IoT devices connected to public networks is the configuration
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Some owners may just put their device online without configuring it properly
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, There have already been studies about the dangers of IoT due to vulnerabilities that users may not be aware of
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," To address these concerns, cybersecurity experts always advise users to apply updates to their IoT devices and to make sure that they don’t use simple easy to guess passwords"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Despite these warnings, people still do careless things"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,Faster networks can also mean faster ways for viruses and malware to spread
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," If more users are on the network, then you also have the potential for more infected devices and systems than ever before"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This is of course a worst case scenario
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, 5G is just the underlying layer for applications and services
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Would building a security protocol on the network like 5G be the ultimate solution? It always remains to be seen, but as of now 5G has not yet been operating on a wide scale for cybersecurity experts to identify the vulnerabilities"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"To counter the threats that faster 5G may bring, cybersecurity vendors are offering a new class of threat management and network security devices"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," There are now security products even for smartphones, since these devices will have the most connections to 5G networks"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, An AV (antivirus) installed on mobile devices like the same way they are installed on desktop computers provides a layer of defense for users by monitoring the device for any malicious activity
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,There are reports that 5G has some network security issues according to Network World
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, In an excerpt from the article:
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,5G network operators will also have to keep a close watch for bad actors who can issue attacks on their systems
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," The small cell towers can even be targeted, so they must be installed in such a way that they are not easily compromised"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The small cells will likely have sensors and cameras to make sure that they are not being tampered with
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,In the US 5G deployment has been encouraged by the FCC under Chairman Ajit Pai
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The FCC is paving the way for a smoother road to 5G deployment by providing the spectrum for coverage
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Ajit Pai calls it the “FAST Plan” or “Facilitate American Superiority in 5G Technology
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,” The US will still look to modify regulations in this space as mentioned by Ajit Pai:
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,Right now major telecom carriers have their own plans for 5G trials in preparation for commercial availability in 2020
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, One such trial that has been reported to the public is in Washington D
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,C
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, This is a project of Verizon and Nokia using the mmWave spectrum
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Verizon provided the network while Nokia tested the radio equipment
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,I would like to think of 5G as a fast flowing river for our digital bitstream
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," We now spend more time on the Internet sending e-mail, collaborating on the cloud, watching streaming content (i"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,e
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,) and engaging social media
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Most of our data is also stored on the network and to access it requires our smartphones
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," With a fast network connection it no longer matters where you are, you will always have access to it"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Our smartphones have become our main device since it provides us mobility to access information from anywhere
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,"Now going back to the user base of billions I mentioned earlier, it will still require upgrades in order to use"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, The current base of mobile users will not have automatic access to 5G because it will require upgrades to hardware
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, That means they will still need to purchase a 5G compatible smartphone or mobile device to get access to the network
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," With that said, there is a potential for further growth among smartphone vendors in this field"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Once 5G rolls users will have to purchase new smartphones
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," Once again, this is going to create jobs for a growing industry as adoption widens in the transition from 4G to 5G"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,The road to 5G will be faced with challenges regarding public health safety and network security
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, It still requires compliance for safety and operation in their respective countries
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," There might be interest groups who may want to capitalize or exploit this situation, which can further delay any rollout"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Citizens can actually voice their concerns that would lead to stoppages of any deployment if a judge rules in their favor
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, There are scientific papers that support both sides of the issues
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, Most of the time it is business interest that wins not the scientific evidence or public confidence
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/," We can see the benefits at this point, but not the effects"
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/, I feel these will need to be addressed in order for a more widely acceptable deployment of 5G
Vince Tabora,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,The explosive growth of technology over the last decade has increased the need to deliver smart products through increasingly economical means
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, Therefore a growing number of buyers consider software outsourcing as an efficient way of embracing new technologies and ensuring their project does not run over the budget
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"Still, negative reviews on remote cooperation and outsourcing have influenced the opinions of many executives and consolidated a number of misconceptions in their minds"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, They avoid setting up remote partnerships as they expect them to fail
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," This, in turn, leads to substantial cost spendings on local experts"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,So is jumping on the outsourcing bandwagon a non-viable strategy? Or is it just one of the common misconceptions? Let’s find out
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,Some executives still hold to an opinion that outsourcing numerous functions is an ill-fated strategy which may lead to complete loss of control and business agility
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," Yet, the quality of software outsourcing services greatly depends on the specification of your provider"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"In this respect, outsourcing vendors generally fall within three categories:"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"In case you are looking for a vendor which may help you close different technological gaps and foster innovation on your project, then the first two categories might not work for you"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, Opt for third category providers which focus on delivering value
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,Don’t hesitate to delegate important functions to your remote developers and allow them to act as your key innovation drivers on the project
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, Each member of your distributed team can bring a fresh vision to your project and help you generate effective solutions to common problems based on his diverse technological background
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"In the era of evolving cyber threats, information protection and software quality should lie at the core of every outsourcing agreement"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, Established software outsourcing providers are concerned about their market reputation and trustworthiness
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, That’s why they have well-thought-out security policies with documented obligations and procedures in place
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"To ensure you get the desired quality and your assets are shielded from intruders, adopt the following practices:"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,Some buyers still believe that outsourcing can lead to complete loss of control due to lack of ongoing face-to-face communication
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," However, the level of control outsourcing offers greatly depends on the cooperation model you choose"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"In project outsourcing model, the control levers are mostly concentrated in the hands of your software development partner"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, He takes control of everything from high-level processes down to assessing the quality of resources in the team
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,The client usually gets involved in the process by reviewing software demos and providing feedback
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," However, the integration of internal processes and experts with distributed teams may be challenging to achieve under the project outsourcing model"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,Whereas another popular cooperation model — IT outstaffing — implies active involvement from the client’s side
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," In this scenario, your technical provider acts as a facilitator while you have full control over the development process and team motivation"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,This model enables you to make final decisions regarding the responsibilities and line-up of your team and have direct access to developer retention and motivation mechanisms
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/, Thus you can easily integrate your business culture and build commitment to common goals among your dedicated developers
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/,"Regardless of the model you chose, regular communication and exchange of feedback are fundamental"
Igor Tkach,https://hackernoon.com/," To facilitate efficient collaboration with your remote team, use separate tools for task tracking (e"
